| **[Shakespearean Sparks: The Dance of Hallucination and Creativity in LLMs' Decoding Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02851v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, a phenomenon often linked to creativity. While previous research has primarily explored this connection through theoretical or qualitative lenses, our work takes a quantitative approach to systematically examine the relationship between hallucination and creativity in LLMs. Given the complex nature of creativity, we propose a narrow definition tailored to LLMs and introduce an evaluation framework, HCL, which quantifies Hallucination and Creativity across different Layers of LLMs during decoding. Our empirical analysis reveals a tradeoff between hallucination and creativity that is consistent across layer depth, model type, and model size. Notably, across different model architectures, we identify a specific layer at each model size that optimally balances this tradeoff. Additionally, the optimal layer tends to appear in the early layers of larger models, and the confidence of the model is also significantly higher at this layer. These findings provide a quantitative perspective that offers new insights into the interplay between LLM creativity and hallucination. The code and data for our experiments are available at https://github.com/ZicongHe2002/HCL-Spark.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an efficient, training-free LLM prompting strategy that enhances detection by translating multilingual text spans into English. Our approach achieves competitive rankings across multiple languages, securing two first positions in low-resource languages. The consistency of our results highlights the effectiveness of our translation strategy for hallucination detection, demonstrating its applicability regardless of the source language.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedHEval: Benchmarking Hallucinations and Mitigation Strategies in Medical Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02157v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are becoming increasingly important in the medical domain, yet Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) frequently generate hallucinations due to limited expertise and the complexity of medical applications. Existing benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate hallucinations based on their underlying causes and lack assessments of mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce MedHEval, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates hallucinations and mitigation strategies in Med-LVLMs by categorizing them into three underlying causes: visual misinterpretation, knowledge deficiency, and context misalignment. We construct a diverse set of close- and open-ended medical VQA datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess these hallucination types. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 popular (Med)-LVLMs and evaluate 7 state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation techniques. Results reveal that Med-LVLMs struggle with hallucinations arising from different causes while existing mitigation methods show limited effectiveness, especially for knowledge- and context-based errors. These findings underscore the need for improved alignment training and specialized mitigation strategies to enhance Med-LVLMs' reliability. MedHEval establishes a standardized framework for evaluating and mitigating medical hallucinations, guiding the development of more trustworthy Med-LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLMs' Assessment of Mixed-Context Hallucination Through the Lens of Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01670v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a widely adopted approach for text quality evaluation, including hallucination evaluation. While previous studies have focused exclusively on single-context evaluation (e.g., discourse faithfulness or world factuality), real-world hallucinations typically involve mixed contexts, which remains inadequately evaluated. In this study, we use summarization as a representative task to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting mixed-context hallucinations, specifically distinguishing between factual and non-factual hallucinations. Through extensive experiments across direct generation and retrieval-based models of varying scales, our main observations are: (1) LLMs' intrinsic knowledge introduces inherent biases in hallucination evaluation; (2) These biases particularly impact the detection of factual hallucinations, yielding a significant performance bottleneck; (3) The fundamental challenge lies in effective knowledge utilization, balancing between LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and external context for accurate mixed-context hallucination evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures for main body</p></details> |
| **[Tackling Hallucination from Conditional Models for Medical Image Reconstruction with DynamicDPS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01075v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations are spurious structures not present in the ground truth, posing a critical challenge in medical image reconstruction, especially for data-driven conditional models. We hypothesize that combining an unconditional diffusion model with data consistency, trained on a diverse dataset, can reduce these hallucinations. Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based framework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to enhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing hallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a conditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse problem solver. DynamicDPS skips early stage in the reverse process by selecting an optimal starting time point per sample and applies Wolfe's line search for adaptive step sizes, improving both efficiency and image fidelity. Using diffusion priors and data consistency, our method effectively reduces hallucinations from any conditional model output. We validate its effectiveness in Image Quality Transfer for low-field MRI enhancement. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real MR scans, including a downstream task for tissue volume estimation, show that DynamicDPS reduces hallucinations, improving relative volume estimation by over 15% for critical tissues while using only 5% of the sampling steps required by baseline diffusion models. As a model-agnostic and fine-tuning-free approach, DynamicDPS offers a robust solution for hallucination reduction in medical imaging. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[NCL-UoR at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Detecting Multilingual Hallucination and Related Observable Overgeneration Text Spans with Modified RefChecker and Modified SeflCheckGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01921v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SemEval-2025 Task 3 (Mu-SHROOM) focuses on detecting hallucinations in content generated by various large language models (LLMs) across multiple languages. This task involves not only identifying the presence of hallucinations but also pinpointing their specific occurrences. To tackle this challenge, this study introduces two methods: modified RefChecker and modified SelfCheckGPT. The modified RefChecker integrates prompt-based factual verification into References, structuring them as claim-based tests rather than single external knowledge sources. The modified SelfCheckGPT incorporates external knowledge to overcome its reliance on internal knowledge. In addition, both methods' original prompt designs are enhanced to identify hallucinated words within LLM-generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving a high ranking on the test dataset in detecting hallucinations across various languages, with an average IoU of 0.5310 and an average COR of 0.5669.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Steer LLM Latents for Hallucination Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01917v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in LLMs pose a significant concern to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR Workshop on Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models (QUESTION), 2025</p></details> |
| **[HalCECE: A Framework for Explainable Hallucination Detection through Conceptual Counterfactuals in Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00436v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, the exploration of hallucinations within vision-language (VL) models emerges as a critical frontier. This work delves into the intricacies of hallucinatory phenomena exhibited by widely used image captioners, unraveling interesting patterns. Specifically, we step upon previously introduced techniques of conceptual counterfactual explanations to address VL hallucinations. The deterministic and efficient nature of the employed conceptual counterfactuals backbone is able to suggest semantically minimal edits driven by hierarchical knowledge, so that the transition from a hallucinated caption to a non-hallucinated one is performed in a black-box manner. HalCECE, our proposed hallucination detection framework is highly interpretable, by providing semantically meaningful edits apart from standalone numbers, while the hierarchical decomposition of hallucinated concepts leads to a thorough hallucination analysis. Another novelty tied to the current work is the investigation of role hallucinations, being one of the first works to involve interconnections between visual concepts in hallucination detection. Overall, HalCECE recommends an explainable direction to the crucial field of VL hallucination detection, thus fostering trustworthy evaluation of current and future VL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Octopus: Alleviating Hallucination via Dynamic Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00361v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have obtained impressive performance in visual content understanding and multi-modal reasoning. Unfortunately, these large models suffer from serious hallucination problems and tend to generate fabricated responses. Recently, several Contrastive Decoding (CD) strategies have been proposed to alleviate hallucination by introducing disturbed inputs. Although great progress has been made, these CD strategies mostly apply a one-size-fits-all approach for all input conditions. In this paper, we revisit this process through extensive experiments. Related results show that hallucination causes are hybrid and each generative step faces a unique hallucination challenge. Leveraging these meaningful insights, we introduce a simple yet effective Octopus-like framework that enables the model to adaptively identify hallucination types and create a dynamic CD workflow. Our Octopus framework not only outperforms existing methods across four benchmarks but also demonstrates excellent deployability and expansibility. Code is available at https://github.com/LijunZhang01/Octopus.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedHallTune: An Instruction-Tuning Benchmark for Mitigating Medical Hallucination in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20780v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of vision-language models (VLMs) in healthcare applications presents great challenges related to hallucinations, in which the models may generate seemingly plausible results that are in fact incorrect. Such hallucinations can jeopardize clinical decision making, potentially harming the diagnosis and treatments. In this work, we propose MedHallTune, a large-scale benchmark designed specifically to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in medical VLMs. Comprising over 100,000 images and 1,000,000 instruction pairs, MedHallTune includes both hallucination and non-hallucination samples, each with ground-truth annotations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current medical and general VLMs using MedHallTune, assessing their performance across key metrics, including clinical accuracy, relevance, detail level, and risk level. The experimental results show that fine-tuning with MedHallTune successfully improves the ability of several existing models to manage hallucinations and boost their zero-shot performance on downstream visual-question-answering (VQA) tasks, making them more reliable for practical medical applications. Our work contributes to the development of more trustworthy VLMs. Codes and dataset will be available at \href{https://github.com/russellyq/MedHallTune}{MedHallTune}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Adaptively Constraining Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20750v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models show tremendous potential in understanding visual information through human languages. However, they are prone to suffer from object hallucination, i.e., the generated image descriptions contain objects that do not exist in the image. In this paper, we reveal that object hallucination can be attributed to overconfidence in irrelevant visual features when soft visual tokens map to the LLM's word embedding space. Specifically, by figuring out the semantic similarity between visual tokens and LLM's word embedding, we observe that the smoothness of similarity distribution strongly correlates with the emergence of object hallucinations. To mitigate hallucinations, we propose using the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to alleviate overconfidence by introducing stochastic noise, facilitating the constraining of irrelevant information. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based noise-controlling strategy to enable the injected noise to be adaptively constrained regarding the smoothness of the similarity distribution. We adapt the proposed AdaVIB across distinct model architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AdaVIB mitigates object hallucinations by effectively alleviating the overconfidence in irrelevant visual features, with consistent improvements on two object hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025.

| **[Vision-Encoders (Already) Know What They See: Mitigating Object Hallucination via Simple Fine-Grained CLIPScore](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20034v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show remarkable performance across various domains. However, these models suffer from object hallucination. This study revisits the previous claim that the primary cause of such hallucination lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis reveals that the capacity of the vision encoder itself is already enough for detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose a Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun phrase level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of 39.6% without additional training. We further validate F-CLIPScore by showing that LVLM trained with the data filtered using F-CLIPScore exhibits reduced hallucination.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Winning Big with Small Models: Knowledge Distillation vs. Self-Training for Reducing Hallucination in QA Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19545v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination-generating false information-and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi'an: A Bilingual Benchmark and Model for Hallucination Detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19209v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) but can still produce inconsistent or unsupported content. Although LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used for RAG hallucination detection due to its implementation simplicity, it faces two main challenges: the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and the lack of domain-optimized judge models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{Bi'an}, a novel framework featuring a bilingual benchmark dataset and lightweight judge models. The dataset supports rigorous evaluation across multiple RAG scenarios, while the judge models are fine-tuned from compact open-source LLMs. Extensive experimental evaluations on Bi'anBench show our 14B model outperforms baseline models with over five times larger parameter scales and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs. We will release our data and models soon at https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Memory Alignment: Mitigating Factual Hallucinations with Generalized Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19127v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. While post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address it by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its existing memory--the knowledge acquired from pre-training data. We introduce self-memory alignment (SMA), which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments show that SMA significantly improves LLMs' overall performance, with consistent enhancement across various benchmarks concerning factuality, as well as helpfulness and comprehensive skills.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures |

However, VQA models still struggle with hallucinations, producing convincing but incorrect answers, particularly in knowledge-driven and Out-of-Distribution scenarios. We introduce FilterRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines BLIP-VQA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground answers in external knowledge sources like Wikipedia and DBpedia. FilterRAG achieves 36.5% accuracy on the OK-VQA dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving robustness in both in-domain and Out-of-Distribution settings. These findings highlight the potential of FilterRAG to improve Visual Question Answering systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination Detection in LLMs Using Spectral Features of Attention Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17598v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

| **[LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Framework for RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17125v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain vulnerable to hallucinated answers despite incorporating external knowledge sources. We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Diffusion Models through Adaptive Attention Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16872v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, while increasingly adept at generating realistic images, are notably hindered by hallucinations -- unrealistic or incorrect features inconsistent with the trained data distribution. In this work, we propose Adaptive Attention Modulation (AAM), a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations by analyzing and modulating the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models. We hypothesize that self-attention during early denoising steps may inadvertently amplify or suppress features, contributing to hallucinations. To counter this, AAM introduces a temperature scaling mechanism within the softmax operation of the self-attention layers, dynamically modulating the attention distribution during inference. Additionally, AAM employs a masked perturbation technique to disrupt early-stage noise that may otherwise propagate into later stages as hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AAM effectively reduces hallucinatory artifacts, enhancing both the fidelity and reliability of generated images. For instance, the proposed approach improves the FID score by 20.8% and reduces the percentage of hallucinated images by 12.9% (in absolute terms) on the Hands dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[MCiteBench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Citation Text Generation in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02589v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced in integrating diverse modalities but frequently suffer from hallucination. A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, overlooking the challenges and opportunities of multimodal contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the multimodal citation text generation ability of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. We comprehensively evaluate models from multiple dimensions, including citation quality, source reliability, and answer accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs struggle with multimodal citation text generation. We also conduct deep analyses of models' performance, revealing that the bottleneck lies in attributing the correct sources rather than understanding the multimodal content.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunBench: Benchmarking Fundus Reading Skills of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00901v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in medical image analysis. However, their capabilities in interpreting fundus images, a critical skill for ophthalmology, remain under-evaluated. Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained task divisions and fail to provide modular analysis of its two key modules, i.e., large language model (LLM) and vision encoder (VE). This paper introduces FunBench, a novel visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' fundus reading skills. FunBench features a hierarchical task organization across four levels (modality perception, anatomy perception, lesion analysis, and disease diagnosis). It also offers three targeted evaluation modes: linear-probe based VE evaluation, knowledge-prompted LLM evaluation, and holistic evaluation. Experiments on nine open-source MLLMs plus GPT-4o reveal significant deficiencies in fundus reading skills, particularly in basic tasks such as laterality recognition. The results highlight the limitations of current MLLMs and emphasize the need for domain-specific training and improved LLMs and VEs.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. To advance this field, we introduce a new REC dataset with two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject non-existent targets, an often-overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. To address fine-grained compositional REC, we propose novel methods based on a Specialist-MLLM collaboration framework, leveraging the complementary strengths of them: Specialist Models handle simpler tasks efficiently, while MLLMs are better suited for complex reasoning. Based on this synergy, we introduce two collaborative strategies. The first, Slow-Fast Adaptation (SFA), employs a routing mechanism to adaptively delegate simple tasks to Specialist Models and complex tasks to MLLMs. Additionally, common error patterns in both models are mitigated through a target-refocus strategy. The second, Candidate Region Selection (CRS), generates multiple bounding box candidates based on Specialist Model and uses the advanced reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to identify the correct target. Extensive experiments on our dataset and other challenging compositional benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The SFA strategy achieves a trade-off between localization accuracy and efficiency, and the CRS strategy greatly boosts the performance of both Specialist Models and MLLMs. We aim for this work to offer valuable insights into solving complex real-world tasks by strategically combining existing tools for maximum effectiveness, rather than reinventing them.</p></details> |  |
| **[AsymLoRA: Harmonizing Data Conflicts and Commonalities in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20035v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective instruction fine-tuning on diverse image-text datasets is crucial for developing a versatile Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), where dataset composition dictates the model's adaptability across multimodal tasks. However, complex datasets often contain inherent conflicts -- stemming from modality-specific optimization objectives -- and latent commonalities that enable cross-task transfer, which most existing approaches handle separately. To bridge this gap, we introduce AsymLoRA, a parameter-efficient tuning framework that unifies knowledge modularization and cross-modal coordination via asymmetric LoRA: task-specific low-rank projections (matrix B) that preserve distinct adaptation pathways for conflicting objectives, and a shared projection (matrix A) that consolidates cross-modal commonalities. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AsymLoRA consistently surpasses both vanilla LoRA, which captures only commonalities, and LoRA-MoE, which focuses solely on conflicts, achieving superior model performance and system efficiency across diverse benchmarks.\href{Code}{https://github.com/Clin0212/HydraLoRA/blob/main/MLLM-HydraLoRA/README.md}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Adversarial Transferability in MLLMs via Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19672v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have recently gained attention for their capabilities in image recognition and understanding. However, while MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the transferability of these attacks across different models remains limited, especially under targeted attack setting. Existing methods primarily focus on vision-specific perturbations but struggle with the complex nature of vision-language modality alignment. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment (DynVLA) Attack, a novel approach that injects dynamic perturbations into the vision-language connector to enhance generalization across diverse vision-language alignment of different models. Our experimental results show that DynVLA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across various MLLMs, including BLIP2, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT4, LLaVA, and closed-source models such as Gemini.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09766</p></details> |
| **[M2-omni: Advancing Omni-MLLM for Comprehensive Modality Support with Competitive Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18778v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

This paper introduces OmniAlign-V, a comprehensive dataset of 200K high-quality training samples featuring diverse images, complex questions, and varied response formats to improve MLLMs' alignment with human preferences. We also present MM-AlignBench, a human-annotated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' alignment with human values.

Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

This capability facilitates more efficient and intelligent data transmission in semantic communications. In this paper, we design a tailored MLLM for semantic communication and propose an MLLM-based Multi-modal, Multi-task and Multi-user Semantic Communication (M4SC) system. First, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to achieve multi-modal alignment in MLLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of semantics representation in the semantic space across different modalities. Next, we introduce a multi-task fine-tuning approach based on task instruction following, which leverages a unified task instruction template to describe various semantic communication tasks, improving the MLLM's ability to follow instructions across multiple tasks. Additionally, by designing a semantic sharing mechanism, we transmit the public and private semantic information of multiple users separately, thus increasing the efficiency of semantic communication. Finally, we employ a joint KAN-LLM-channel coding strategy to comprehensively enhance the performance of the semantic communication system in complex communication environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed M4SC in multi-modal, multi-task, and multi-user scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Intuitively, leveraging past events as memory can enrich contextual and temporal understanding of the current event. In this paper, we show that leveraging memories as contexts helps MLLMs better understand video events. However, because such memories rely on predictions of preceding events, they may contain misinformation, leading to confabulation and degraded performance. To address this, we propose a confabulation-aware memory modification method that mitigates confabulated memory for memory-enhanced event understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper (5 pages)</p></details> |

Texts describing cultural procedures, including rituals, traditional craftsmanship, and social etiquette, require an inherent understanding of cultural context, presenting a significant challenge for mLLMs. In this work, we introduce CAPTex, a benchmark designed to evaluate mLLMs' ability to process and reason about culturally diverse procedural texts across multiple languages using various methodologies to assess their performance. Our findings indicate that (1) mLLMs face difficulties with culturally contextualized procedural texts, showing notable performance declines in low-resource languages, (2) model performance fluctuates across cultural domains, with some areas presenting greater difficulties, and (3) language models exhibit better performance on multiple-choice tasks within conversational frameworks compared to direct questioning. These results underscore the current limitations of mLLMs in handling culturally nuanced procedural texts and highlight the need for culturally aware benchmarks like CAPTex to enhance their adaptability and comprehension across diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Both Correctness and Coverage of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14914v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rendered traditional visual captioning benchmarks obsolete, as they primarily evaluate short descriptions with outdated metrics. While recent benchmarks address these limitations by decomposing captions into visual elements and adopting model-based evaluation, they remain incomplete-overlooking critical aspects, while providing vague, non-explanatory scores. To bridge this gap, we propose CV-CapBench, a Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark that systematically evaluates caption quality across 6 views and 13 dimensions. CV-CapBench introduces precision, recall, and hit rate metrics for each dimension, uniquely assessing both correctness and coverage. Experiments on leading MLLMs reveal significant capability gaps, particularly in dynamic and knowledge-intensive dimensions. These findings provide actionable insights for future research. The code and data will be released.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This study unmasks the culprit: "temporal hacking", a phenomenon where models shortcut by fixating on select frames, missing the full video narrative. In this work, we systematically establish a comprehensive theory of temporal hacking, defining it from a reinforcement learning perspective, introducing the Temporal Perplexity (TPL) score to assess this misalignment, and proposing the Unhackable Temporal Rewarding (UTR) framework to mitigate the temporal hacking. Both theoretically and empirically, TPL proves to be a reliable indicator of temporal modeling quality, correlating strongly with frame activation patterns. Extensive experiments reveal that UTR not only counters temporal hacking but significantly elevates video comprehension capabilities. This work not only advances video-AI systems but also illuminates the critical importance of aligning proxy rewards with true objectives in MLLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

| **[Mitigating Visual Knowledge Forgetting in MLLM Instruction-tuning via Modality-decoupled Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11740v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent MLLMs have shown emerging visual understanding and reasoning abilities after being pre-trained on large-scale multimodal datasets. Unlike pre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment, instruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading to the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual forgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual learning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing visual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention, which further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the degradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation through the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that leads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on this view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that regulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual representations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the information bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual understanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual knowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight instruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach using gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational overhead while preserving rich visual representations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks and backbone MLLMs demonstrate that MDGD effectively mitigates visual forgetting from pre-trained tasks while enabling strong adaptation to new tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To address this challenge, we propose Vision Dynamic Embedding-Guided Pretraining (VDEP), a hybrid autoregressive training paradigm for MLLMs. Utilizing dynamic embeddings from the MLP following the visual encoder, this approach supervises image hidden states and integrates image tokens into autoregressive training. Existing MLLMs primarily focused on recovering information from textual inputs, often neglecting the effective processing of image data. In contrast, the key improvement of this work is the reinterpretation of multimodal alignment as a process of recovering information from input data, with particular emphasis on reconstructing detailed visual features.The proposed method seamlessly integrates into standard models without architectural changes. Experiments on 13 benchmarks show VDEP outperforms baselines, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey on AI-Generated Media Detection: From Non-MLLM to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05240v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of AI-generated media poses significant challenges to information authenticity and social trust, making reliable detection methods highly demanded. Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research. Additionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks, ethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns. We examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across various jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local or remote disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated integrated reuse and recompute mechanisms within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54% reduction in response time compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, the first version</p></details> |

The key distinction lies in how visual tokens are processed. Decoder-only architectures apply self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens, while cross-attention architectures skip these computations. To investigate whether redundancy exists in this computationally expensive process, we propose a training-free framework for analyzing trained MLLMs. It consists of Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN and Hollow Attention, which enable adjustable reductions in computations for visual tokens, as well as a Layer Ranking Algorithm that prioritizes layers for these reductions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial, structured, and clustered redundancy unique to decoder-only MLLMs, offering valuable insights for future MLLM architecture design. Furthermore, by leveraging our reduction framework as a training-free inference acceleration approach, we achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods while remaining compatible with them. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/L-Hugh/RedundancyLens.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Unsupervised Prefix Fine-Tuning (UPFT), which leverages the observation of Prefix Self-Consistency -- the shared initial reasoning steps across diverse solution trajectories -- to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency. By training exclusively on the initial prefix substrings (as few as 8 tokens), UPFT removes the need for labeled data or exhaustive sampling. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that UPFT matches the performance of supervised methods such as Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning, while reducing training time by 75% and sampling cost by 99%. Further analysis reveals that errors tend to appear in later stages of the reasoning process and that prefix-based training preserves the model's structural knowledge. This work demonstrates how minimal unsupervised fine-tuning can unlock substantial reasoning gains in LLMs, offering a scalable and resource-efficient alternative to conventional approaches.</p></details> |  |

Answer consistency across input variations can thus be taken as a sign of stronger confidence. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a framework, {\em Multidimensional Reasoning Consistency} where, focusing on math problems, models are systematically pushed to diversify solution paths towards a final answer, thereby testing them for answer consistency across multiple input variations. We induce variations in (i) order of shots in prompt, (ii) problem phrasing, and (iii) languages used. Extensive experiments on a large range of open-source state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes show that reasoning consistency differs by variation dimension, and that by aggregating consistency across dimensions, our framework consistently enhances mathematical reasoning performance on both monolingual dataset GSM8K and multilingual dataset MGSM, especially for smaller models.</p></details> |  |

However, current MAS frameworks are limited by poor flexibility and scalability, with underdeveloped optimization strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ReSo, which integrates task graph generation with a reward-driven two-stage agent selection process. The core of ReSo is the proposed Collaborative Reward Model, which can provide fine-grained reward signals for MAS cooperation for optimization. We also introduce an automated data synthesis framework for generating MAS benchmarks, without human annotations. Experimentally, ReSo matches or outperforms existing methods. ReSo achieves \textbf{33.7\%} and \textbf{32.3\%} accuracy on Math-MAS and SciBench-MAS SciBench, while other methods completely fail.

| **[An Efficient and Precise Training Data Construction Framework for Process-supervised Reward Model in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02382v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |

Unlike human evaluation, existing automated evaluation metrics lack high-level semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities for video, thus making them infeasible and unexplainable. To fill this gap, we curate GRADEO-Instruct, a multi-dimensional T2V evaluation instruction tuning dataset, including 3.3k videos from over 10 existing video generation models and multi-step reasoning assessments converted by 16k human annotations. We then introduce GRADEO, one of the first specifically designed video evaluation models, which grades AI-generated videos for explainable scores and assessments through multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that our method aligns better with human evaluations than existing methods. Furthermore, our benchmarking reveals that current video generation models struggle to produce content that aligns with human reasoning and complex real-world scenarios.

However, the scarcity of sufficiently challenging problems, particularly at the Olympiad level, hinders further advancements. In this work, we introduce PromptCoT, a novel approach for automatically generating high-quality Olympiad-level math problems. The proposed method synthesizes complex problems based on mathematical concepts and the rationale behind problem construction, emulating the thought processes of experienced problem designers. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that an optimal rationale should maximize both the likelihood of rationale generation given the associated concepts and the likelihood of problem generation conditioned on both the rationale and the concepts. Our method is evaluated on standard benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, where it consistently outperforms existing problem generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PromptCoT exhibits superior data scalability, consistently maintaining high performance as the dataset size increases, outperforming the baselines.

Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning.

While previous research has identified model collapse as a risk in self-improvement, where model outputs become increasingly deterministic, we discover a more fundamental challenge: the superficial self-improved reasoners phenomenon. In particular, our analysis reveals that even when LMs show improved in-domain (ID) reasoning accuracy, they actually compromise their generalized reasoning capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks due to memorization rather than genuine. Through a systematic investigation of LM architecture, we discover that during self-improvement, LM weight updates are concentrated in less reasoning-critical layers, leading to superficial learning. To address this, we propose Iterative Model Merging (IMM), a method that strategically combines weights from original and self-improved models to preserve generalization while incorporating genuine reasoning improvements. Our approach effectively mitigates both LM collapse and superficial learning, moving towards more stable self-improving systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose CatAttack, an automated iterative attack pipeline for generating triggers on a weaker, less expensive proxy model (DeepSeek V3) and successfully transfer them to more advanced reasoning target models like DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-distilled-Qwen-32B, resulting in greater than 300% increase in the likelihood of the target model generating an incorrect answer. For example, appending, "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives," to any math problem leads to more than doubling the chances of a model getting the answer wrong. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in reasoning models, revealing that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to subtle adversarial inputs, raising security and reliability concerns.

| **[Why Is Spatial Reasoning Hard for VLMs? An Attention Mechanism Perspective on Focus Areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01773v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost. We make code and data publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/shiqichen17/AdaptVis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-hop Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Self-Distillation with Multi-Prompt Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01754v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models have seen rapid advancement alongside large language models. However, while language models can effectively leverage chain-of-thought prompting for zero or few-shot learning, similar prompting strategies are less effective for multi-modal LLMs due to modality gaps and task complexity. To address this challenge, we explore two prompting approaches: a dual-query method that separates multi-modal input analysis and answer generation into two prompting steps, and an ensemble prompting method that combines multiple prompt variations to arrive at the final answer. Although these approaches enhance the model's reasoning capabilities without fine-tuning, they introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, building on top of these two prompting techniques, we propose a self-distillation framework such that the model can improve itself without any annotated data. Our self-distillation framework learns representation intervention modules from the reasoning traces collected from ensembled dual-query prompts, in the form of hidden representations. The lightweight intervention modules operate in parallel with the frozen original model, which makes it possible to maintain computational efficiency while significantly improving model capability. We evaluate our method on five widely-used VQA benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in performing multi-hop reasoning for complex tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first investigation into integrating step-wise knowledge graph retrieval with step-wise reasoning to address these challenges, introducing a novel paradigm termed as graph-augmented reasoning. Our goal is to enable frozen, small-scale LLMs to retrieve and process relevant mathematical knowledge in a step-wise manner, enhancing their problem-solving abilities without additional training. To this end, we propose KG-RAR, a framework centered on process-oriented knowledge graph construction, a hierarchical retrieval strategy, and a universal post-retrieval processing and reward model (PRP-RM) that refines retrieved information and evaluates each reasoning step. Experiments on the Math500 and GSM8K benchmarks across six models demonstrate that KG-RAR yields encouraging results, achieving a 20.73\% relative improvement with Llama-3B on Math500.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Reasoning with Transformers, RNNs, and Chain of Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01544v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study and compare the expressive power of transformers, RNNs, and transformers with chain of thought tokens on a simple and natural class of problems we term Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ). This family captures problems like evaluating Boolean formulas and multi-step word problems. Assuming standard hardness assumptions from circuit complexity and communication complexity, we prove that none of these three architectures is capable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension, and number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the input. We also provide a construction for each architecture that solves CRQs. For transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the problem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and sufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. (Otherwise, a linear dimension is necessary). For transformers with chain of thought, our construction uses $n$ CoT tokens. These results show that, while CRQs are inherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to overcome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture has strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC) Improving LLMs' Reasoning of Authentic Implicit Toxic Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01539v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-v2.5 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to both direct prompting and Chain-of-Thought. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Distillation--post-training on LRMs-generated data--is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e. over-thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning(RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing tree-based CoT data from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the construted data.</p></details> |  |

Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control. Experimental evaluations using our open-source benchmark, CognitiveDroneBench, reveal that while a racing-oriented model (RaceVLA) achieves an overall success rate of 31.3%, the base CognitiveDrone model reaches 59.6%, and CognitiveDrone-R1 attains a success rate of 77.2%. These results demonstrate improvements of up to 30% in critical cognitive tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities into UAV control systems. Our contributions include the development of a state-of-the-art VLA model for UAV control and the introduction of the first dedicated benchmark for assessing cognitive tasks in drone operations.

| **[Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners, or, Four Habits of Highly Effective STaRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01307v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.</p></details> |  |

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

However, current MAS frameworks are limited by poor flexibility and scalability, with underdeveloped optimization strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ReSo, which integrates task graph generation with a reward-driven two-stage agent selection process. The core of ReSo is the proposed Collaborative Reward Model, which can provide fine-grained reward signals for MAS cooperation for optimization. We also introduce an automated data synthesis framework for generating MAS benchmarks, without human annotations. Experimentally, ReSo matches or outperforms existing methods. ReSo achieves \textbf{33.7\%} and \textbf{32.3\%} accuracy on Math-MAS and SciBench-MAS SciBench, while other methods completely fail.

| **[An Efficient and Precise Training Data Construction Framework for Process-supervised Reward Model in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02382v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are pronounced in cases of limited training data, highlighting DIST2Loss's effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

This approach modifies the backward process of a pretrained diffusion model to construct a bridge that converges to an implicit distribution associated with the editing target at time 0. Building on this framework, we propose h-Edit, a novel editing method that utilizes Doob's h-transform and Langevin Monte Carlo to decompose the update of an intermediate edited sample into two components: a "reconstruction" term and an "editing" term. This decomposition provides flexibility, allowing the reconstruction term to be computed via existing inversion techniques and enabling the combination of multiple editing terms to handle complex editing tasks. To our knowledge, h-Edit is the first training-free method capable of performing simultaneous text-guided and reward-model-based editing. Extensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, show that h-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of editing effectiveness and faithfulness.

While existing synthetic instruction data selection strategies rely mainly on single-dimensional signals (i.e., reward scores, model perplexity), they fail to capture the complexity of instruction-following across diverse fields. Therefore, we investigate more diverse signals to capture comprehensive instruction-response pair characteristics and propose three foundational metrics that leverage Multi-LLM wisdom, informed by (1) diverse LLM responses and (2) reward model assessment. Building upon base metrics, we propose CrowdSelect, an integrated metric incorporating a clustering-based approach to maintain response diversity. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our foundation metrics consistently improve performance across 4 base models on MT-bench and Arena-Hard. CrowdSelect, efficiently incorporating all metrics, achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Full and LoRA fine-tuning, showing improvements of 4.81% on Arena-Hard and 11.1% on MT-bench with Llama-3.2-3b-instruct.

By integrating a mixture of LoRA experts, CoPL efficiently fine-tunes LLMs while dynamically balancing shared and user-specific preferences. Additionally, an optimization-free adaptation strategy enables generalization to unseen users without fine-tuning. Experiments on UltraFeedback-P demonstrate that CoPL outperforms existing personalized reward models, effectively capturing both common and controversial preferences, making it a scalable solution for personalized LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages, 4 figures, 6tables</p></details> |

Best-of-N (BoN) sampling serves as a common scaling technique, broadening the search space for finding better solutions from the model distribution. However, traditional BoN requires N full generations, leading to high GPU memory overhead and time latency. Moreover, some methods depend on reward models, adding computational cost and limiting domain generalization. In this paper, we propose Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN), a novel decoding method that avoids fully generating all samplings and eliminates the need for reward models. ST-BoN introduces early sampling consistency to estimate the most promising sample, truncating suboptimal ones to free memory and accelerate inference. This pushes the sampling-efficient test-time scaling. Compared to traditional BoN, ST-BoN can reduce dynamic GPU memory overhead by over 90% and time latency by 50%, while achieving comparable or even better performance across reasoning and open-ended domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[All Roads Lead to Likelihood: The Value of Reinforcement Learning in Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01067v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a first-principles perspective, it may seem odd that the strongest results in foundation model fine-tuning (FT) are achieved via a relatively complex, two-stage training procedure. Specifically, one first trains a reward model (RM) on some dataset (e.g. human preferences) before using it to provide online feedback as part of a downstream reinforcement learning (RL) procedure, rather than directly optimizing the policy parameters on the dataset via offline maximum likelihood estimation. In fact, from an information-theoretic perspective, we can only lose information via passing through a reward model and cannot create any new information via on-policy sampling. To explain this discrepancy, we scrutinize several hypotheses on the value of RL in FT through both theoretical and empirical lenses. Of the hypotheses considered, we find the most support for the explanation that on problems with a generation-verification gap, the combination of the ease of learning the relatively simple RM (verifier) from the preference data, coupled with the ability of the downstream RL procedure to then filter its search space to the subset of policies (generators) that are optimal for relatively simple verifiers is what leads to the superior performance of online FT.</p></details> |  |

Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated exceptional promise in enhancing reasoning by providing step-wise feedback, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning. However, their application to broader reasoning domains remains understudied, largely due to the high costs associated with manually creating step-level supervision. In this work, we explore the potential of PRMs in graph reasoning problems - a domain that demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning and offers opportunities for automated step-level data generation using established graph algorithms. We introduce GraphSILO, the largest dataset for graph reasoning problems with fine-grained step-wise labels, built using automated Task-oriented Trajectories and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate detailed reasoning steps with step-wise labels. Building upon this dataset, we train GraphPRM, the first PRM designed for graph reasoning problems, and evaluate its effectiveness in two key settings: inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that GraphPRM significantly improves LLM performance across 13 graph reasoning tasks, delivering a 9% gain for Qwen2.5-7B and demonstrating transferability to new graph reasoning datasets and new reasoning domains like mathematical problem-solving. Notably, GraphPRM enhances LLM performance on GSM8K and Math500, underscoring the cross-domain applicability of graph-based reasoning rewards. Our findings highlight the potential of PRMs in advancing reasoning across diverse domains, paving the way for more versatile and effective LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RLHF methods are non-robust, and their performance deteriorates if the downstream task differs significantly from the preference dataset used in fine-tuning. In order to mitigate this problem, we introduce a distributionally robust RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs. In particular, our goal is to ensure that a fine-tuned model retains its performance even when the distribution of prompts significantly differs from the distribution encountered during fine-tuning. We formulate distributionally robust optimization (DRO) version of two popular fine-tuning methods -- (1) reward-based RLHF and (2) reward-free DPO (direct preference optimization). We propose a minibatch gradient descent based algorithms for both of them, and theoretically prove convergence guarantees for the algorithms. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms on an out-of-distribution (OOD) task by first training the model on the Unified-Feedback dataset and evaluating its performance on two different datasets. The experimental results show that our robust training improves the accuracy of the learned reward models on average, and markedly on some tasks, such as reasoning. Furthermore, we show that the robust versions of policy optimization methods, similarly improve performance on OOD tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Learning from Multiple Feedback Types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21038v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning rewards from preference feedback has become an important tool in the alignment of agentic models. Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a binary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to acquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts is often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals of a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be mutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases for the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning from different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively. In this paper, we bridge this gap by enabling experimentation and evaluating multi-type feedback in a broad set of environments. We present a process to generate high-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement reward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types. Based on the simulated feedback, we investigate the use of types of feedback across ten RL environments and compare them to pure preference-based baselines. We show empirically that diverse types of feedback can be utilized and lead to strong reward modeling performance. This work is the first strong indicator of the potential of multi-type feedback for RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating Distribution Shift in Synthetic Data for Machine Translation Quality Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19941v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality Estimation (QE) models evaluate the quality of machine translations without reference translations, serving as the reward models for the translation task. Due to the data scarcity, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution. However, synthetic QE data often suffers from distribution shift, which can manifest as discrepancies between pseudo and real translations, or in pseudo labels that do not align with human preferences. To tackle this issue, we introduce ADSQE, a novel framework for alleviating distribution shift in synthetic QE data. To reduce the difference between pseudo and real translations, we employ the constrained beam search algorithm and enhance translation diversity through the use of distinct generation models. ADSQE uses references, i.e., translation supervision signals, to guide both the generation and annotation processes, enhancing the quality of word-level labels. ADSE further identifies the shortest phrase covering consecutive error tokens, mimicking human annotation behavior, to assign the final phrase-level labels. Specially, we underscore that the translation model can not annotate translations of itself accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like COMET in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Further analysis offers insights into synthetic data generation that could benefit reward models for other tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Learning Unlocks LLMs' Psycho-Counseling Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19731v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying large language models (LLMs) to assist in psycho-counseling is an emerging and meaningful approach, driven by the significant gap between patient needs and the availability of mental health support. However, current LLMs struggle to consistently provide effective responses to client speeches, largely due to the lack of supervision from high-quality real psycho-counseling data, whose content is typically inaccessible due to client privacy concerns. Furthermore, the quality of therapists' responses in available sessions can vary significantly based on their professional training and experience. Assessing the quality of therapists' responses remains an open challenge. In this work, we address these challenges by first proposing a set of professional and comprehensive principles to evaluate therapists' responses to client speeches. Using these principles, we create a preference dataset, PsychoCounsel-Preference, which contains 36k high-quality preference comparison pairs. This dataset aligns with the preferences of professional psychotherapists, providing a robust foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in psycho-counseling. Experiments on reward modeling and preference learning demonstrate that PsychoCounsel-Preference is an excellent resource for LLMs to acquire essential skills for responding to clients in a counseling session. Our best-aligned model, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B, achieves an impressive win rate of 87% against GPT-4o. We release PsychoCounsel-Preference, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B and the reward model PsychoCounsel Llama3-8B-Reward to facilitate the research of psycho-counseling with LLMs at: https://hf.co/Psychotherapy-LLM.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

This integrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning process, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We particularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models autonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when to terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a two-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning models using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential rejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that incorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning models on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of self-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the models' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction capabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on external reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distill Not Only Data but Also Rewards: Can Smaller Language Models Surpass Larger Ones?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19557v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling large language models (LLMs) typically involves transferring the teacher model's responses through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, this approach neglects the potential to distill both data (output content) and reward signals (quality evaluations). Extracting reliable reward signals directly from teacher models is challenging, as LLMs are optimized for generation rather than evaluation, often resulting in biased or inconsistent assessments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel distillation pipeline that transfers both responses and rewards. Our method generates pseudo-rewards through a self-supervised mechanism that leverages the inherent structure of both teacher and student responses, enabling reward learning without explicit external evaluation. The reward model subsequently guides reinforcement learning (RL), allowing iterative refinement of the student model after an SFT warm-up phase. Experiments on GSM8K and MMLU-PRO demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional SFT-based approaches, enabling student models to surpass the performance of their teachers. This work highlights the potential for scalable, efficient distillation through structured self-supervised reward learning, reducing dependence on external reward supervision.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Large Language Models Detect Errors in Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19361v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first four authors contributed equally, 27 pages</p></details> |

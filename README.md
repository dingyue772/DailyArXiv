| **[MedHallTune: An Instruction-Tuning Benchmark for Mitigating Medical Hallucination in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20780v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of vision-language models (VLMs) in healthcare applications presents great challenges related to hallucinations, in which the models may generate seemingly plausible results that are in fact incorrect. Such hallucinations can jeopardize clinical decision making, potentially harming the diagnosis and treatments. In this work, we propose MedHallTune, a large-scale benchmark designed specifically to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in medical VLMs. Comprising over 100,000 images and 1,000,000 instruction pairs, MedHallTune includes both hallucination and non-hallucination samples, each with ground-truth annotations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current medical and general VLMs using MedHallTune, assessing their performance across key metrics, including clinical accuracy, relevance, detail level, and risk level. The experimental results show that fine-tuning with MedHallTune successfully improves the ability of several existing models to manage hallucinations and boost their zero-shot performance on downstream visual-question-answering (VQA) tasks, making them more reliable for practical medical applications. Our work contributes to the development of more trustworthy VLMs. Codes and dataset will be available at \href{https://github.com/russellyq/MedHallTune}{MedHallTune}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Adaptively Constraining Information Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20750v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models show tremendous potential in understanding visual information through human languages. However, they are prone to suffer from object hallucination, i.e., the generated image descriptions contain objects that do not exist in the image. In this paper, we reveal that object hallucination can be attributed to overconfidence in irrelevant visual features when soft visual tokens map to the LLM's word embedding space. Specifically, by figuring out the semantic similarity between visual tokens and LLM's word embedding, we observe that the smoothness of similarity distribution strongly correlates with the emergence of object hallucinations. To mitigate hallucinations, we propose using the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to alleviate overconfidence by introducing stochastic noise, facilitating the constraining of irrelevant information. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based noise-controlling strategy to enable the injected noise to be adaptively constrained regarding the smoothness of the similarity distribution. We adapt the proposed AdaVIB across distinct model architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AdaVIB mitigates object hallucinations by effectively alleviating the overconfidence in irrelevant visual features, with consistent improvements on two object hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025.

| **[Vision-Encoders (Already) Know What They See: Mitigating Object Hallucination via Simple Fine-Grained CLIPScore](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20034v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show remarkable performance across various domains. However, these models suffer from object hallucination. This study revisits the previous claim that the primary cause of such hallucination lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis reveals that the capacity of the vision encoder itself is already enough for detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose a Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun phrase level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of 39.6% without additional training. We further validate F-CLIPScore by showing that LVLM trained with the data filtered using F-CLIPScore exhibits reduced hallucination.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Winning Big with Small Models: Knowledge Distillation vs. Self-Training for Reducing Hallucination in QA Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19545v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination-generating false information-and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi'an: A Bilingual Benchmark and Model for Hallucination Detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19209v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) but can still produce inconsistent or unsupported content. Although LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used for RAG hallucination detection due to its implementation simplicity, it faces two main challenges: the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and the lack of domain-optimized judge models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{Bi'an}, a novel framework featuring a bilingual benchmark dataset and lightweight judge models. The dataset supports rigorous evaluation across multiple RAG scenarios, while the judge models are fine-tuned from compact open-source LLMs. Extensive experimental evaluations on Bi'anBench show our 14B model outperforms baseline models with over five times larger parameter scales and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs. We will release our data and models soon at https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Memory Alignment: Mitigating Factual Hallucinations with Generalized Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19127v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. While post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address it by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its existing memory--the knowledge acquired from pre-training data. We introduce self-memory alignment (SMA), which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments show that SMA significantly improves LLMs' overall performance, with consistent enhancement across various benchmarks concerning factuality, as well as helpfulness and comprehensive skills.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures |
| **[FilterRAG: Zero-Shot Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Mitigate Hallucinations in VQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18536v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answering requires models to generate accurate answers by integrating visual and textual understanding. However, VQA models still struggle with hallucinations, producing convincing but incorrect answers, particularly in knowledge-driven and Out-of-Distribution scenarios. We introduce FilterRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines BLIP-VQA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground answers in external knowledge sources like Wikipedia and DBpedia. FilterRAG achieves 36.5% accuracy on the OK-VQA dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving robustness in both in-domain and Out-of-Distribution settings. These findings highlight the potential of FilterRAG to improve Visual Question Answering systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination Detection in LLMs Using Spectral Features of Attention Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17598v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

| **[LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Framework for RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17125v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain vulnerable to hallucinated answers despite incorporating external knowledge sources. We present LettuceDetect a framework that addresses two critical limitations in existing hallucination detection methods: (1) the context window constraints of traditional encoder-based methods, and (2) the computational inefficiency of LLM based approaches. Building on ModernBERT's extended context capabilities (up to 8k tokens) and trained on the RAGTruth benchmark dataset, our approach outperforms all previous encoder-based models and most prompt-based models, while being approximately 30 times smaller than the best models. LettuceDetect is a token-classification model that processes context-question-answer triples, allowing for the identification of unsupported claims at the token level. Evaluations on the RAGTruth corpus demonstrate an F1 score of 79.22% for example-level detection, which is a 14.8% improvement over Luna, the previous state-of-the-art encoder-based architecture. Additionally, the system can process 30 to 60 examples per second on a single GPU, making it more practical for real-world RAG applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Diffusion Models through Adaptive Attention Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16872v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, while increasingly adept at generating realistic images, are notably hindered by hallucinations -- unrealistic or incorrect features inconsistent with the trained data distribution. In this work, we propose Adaptive Attention Modulation (AAM), a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations by analyzing and modulating the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models. We hypothesize that self-attention during early denoising steps may inadvertently amplify or suppress features, contributing to hallucinations. To counter this, AAM introduces a temperature scaling mechanism within the softmax operation of the self-attention layers, dynamically modulating the attention distribution during inference. Additionally, AAM employs a masked perturbation technique to disrupt early-stage noise that may otherwise propagate into later stages as hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AAM effectively reduces hallucinatory artifacts, enhancing both the fidelity and reliability of generated images. For instance, the proposed approach improves the FID score by 20.8% and reduces the percentage of hallucinated images by 12.9% (in absolute terms) on the Hands dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Causes and Mitigation of Hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16842v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrate image encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) to process multi-modal inputs and perform complex visual tasks. However, they often generate hallucinations by describing non-existent objects or attributes, compromising their reliability. This study analyzes hallucination patterns in image captioning, showing that not all tokens in the generation process are influenced by image input and that image dependency can serve as a useful signal for hallucination detection. To address this, we develop an automated pipeline to identify hallucinated objects and train a token-level classifier using hidden representations from parallel inference passes-with and without image input. Leveraging this classifier, we introduce a decoding strategy that effectively controls hallucination rates in image captioning at inference time.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The Law of Knowledge Overshadowing: Towards Understanding, Predicting, and Preventing LLM Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16143v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination is a persistent challenge in large language models (LLMs), where even with rigorous quality control, models often generate distorted facts. This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality training data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM mechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing, where model's dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during text generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on this idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by modeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear law, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly with the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length, and (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify hallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model training or inference. Built on overshadowing effect, we propose a new decoding strategy CoDa, to mitigate hallucinations, which notably enhance model factuality on Overshadow (27.9%), MemoTrap (13.1%) and NQ-Swap (18.3%). Our findings not only deepen understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind hallucinations but also provide actionable insights for developing more predictable and controllable language models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[The Role of Background Information in Reducing Object Hallucination in Vision-Language Models: Insights from Cutoff API Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15389v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) occasionally generate outputs that contradict input images, constraining their reliability in real-world applications. While visual prompting is reported to suppress hallucinations by augmenting prompts with relevant area inside an image, the effectiveness in terms of the area remains uncertain. This study analyzes success and failure cases of Attention-driven visual prompting in object hallucination, revealing that preserving background context is crucial for mitigating object hallucination.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Can Hallucination Correction Improve Video-Language Alignment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15079v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models often generate hallucinated content that is not grounded in its visual inputs. While prior work focuses on mitigating hallucinations, we instead explore leveraging hallucination correction as a training objective to improve video-language alignment. We introduce HACA, a self-training framework learning to correct hallucinations in descriptions that do not align with the video content. By identifying and correcting inconsistencies, HACA enhances the model's ability to align video and textual representations for spatio-temporal reasoning. Our experimental results show consistent gains in video-caption binding and text-to-video retrieval tasks, demonstrating that hallucination correction-inspired tasks serve as an effective strategy for improving vision and language alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verify when Uncertain: Beyond Self-Consistency in Black Box Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15845v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucination problems, which hinder their reliability in sensitive applications. In the black-box setting, several self-consistency-based techniques have been proposed for hallucination detection. We empirically study these techniques and show that they achieve performance close to that of a supervised (still black-box) oracle, suggesting little room for improvement within this paradigm. To address this limitation, we explore cross-model consistency checking between the target model and an additional verifier LLM. With this extra information, we observe improved oracle performance compared to purely self-consistency-based methods. We then propose a budget-friendly, two-stage detection algorithm that calls the verifier model only for a subset of cases. It dynamically switches between self-consistency and cross-consistency based on an uncertainty interval of the self-consistency classifier. We provide a geometric interpretation of consistency-based hallucination detection methods through the lens of kernel mean embeddings, offering deeper theoretical insights. Extensive experiments show that this approach maintains high detection performance while significantly reducing computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Hallucinations of Medical Multimodal Large Language Models with Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15040v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance in vision and text tasks. However, hallucination remains a major challenge, especially in fields like healthcare where details are critical. In this work, we show how MLLMs may be enhanced to support Visual RAG (V-RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation framework that incorporates both text and visual data from retrieved images. On the MIMIC-CXR chest X-ray report generation and Multicare medical image caption generation datasets, we show that Visual RAG improves the accuracy of entity probing, which asks whether a medical entities is grounded by an image. We show that the improvements extend both to frequent and rare entities, the latter of which may have less positive training data. Downstream, we apply V-RAG with entity probing to correct hallucinations and generate more clinically accurate X-ray reports, obtaining a higher RadGraph-F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>GenAI...</summary><p>GenAI4Health - AAAI '25</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models with Metamorphic Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15844v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score). For instance, with Mistral-7B, MetaQA achieves an average F1-score of 0.435, compared to SelfCheckGPT's F1-score of 0.205, representing an improvement rate of 112.2%. MetaQA also demonstrates superiority across all different categories of questions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |
| **[MedHallu: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Detecting Medical Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14302v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increasing use in medical question-answering necessitate rigorous evaluation of their reliability. A critical challenge lies in hallucination, where models generate plausible yet factually incorrect outputs. In the medical domain, this poses serious risks to patient safety and clinical decision-making. To address this, we introduce MedHallu, the first benchmark specifically designed for medical hallucination detection. MedHallu comprises 10,000 high-quality question-answer pairs derived from PubMedQA, with hallucinated answers systematically generated through a controlled pipeline. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, and the medically fine-tuned UltraMedical, struggle with this binary hallucination detection task, with the best model achieving an F1 score as low as 0.625 for detecting "hard" category hallucinations. Using bidirectional entailment clustering, we show that harder-to-detect hallucinations are semantically closer to ground truth. Through experiments, we also show incorporating domain-specific knowledge and introducing a "not sure" category as one of the answer categories improves the precision and F1 scores by up to 38% relative to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at https://medhallu.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. To advance this field, we introduce a new REC dataset with two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject non-existent targets, an often-overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. To address fine-grained compositional REC, we propose novel methods based on a Specialist-MLLM collaboration framework, leveraging the complementary strengths of them: Specialist Models handle simpler tasks efficiently, while MLLMs are better suited for complex reasoning. Based on this synergy, we introduce two collaborative strategies. The first, Slow-Fast Adaptation (SFA), employs a routing mechanism to adaptively delegate simple tasks to Specialist Models and complex tasks to MLLMs. Additionally, common error patterns in both models are mitigated through a target-refocus strategy. The second, Candidate Region Selection (CRS), generates multiple bounding box candidates based on Specialist Model and uses the advanced reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to identify the correct target. Extensive experiments on our dataset and other challenging compositional benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The SFA strategy achieves a trade-off between localization accuracy and efficiency, and the CRS strategy greatly boosts the performance of both Specialist Models and MLLMs. We aim for this work to offer valuable insights into solving complex real-world tasks by strategically combining existing tools for maximum effectiveness, rather than reinventing them.</p></details> |  |
| **[AsymLoRA: Harmonizing Data Conflicts and Commonalities in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20035v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective instruction fine-tuning on diverse image-text datasets is crucial for developing a versatile Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), where dataset composition dictates the model's adaptability across multimodal tasks. However, complex datasets often contain inherent conflicts -- stemming from modality-specific optimization objectives -- and latent commonalities that enable cross-task transfer, which most existing approaches handle separately. To bridge this gap, we introduce AsymLoRA, a parameter-efficient tuning framework that unifies knowledge modularization and cross-modal coordination via asymmetric LoRA: task-specific low-rank projections (matrix B) that preserve distinct adaptation pathways for conflicting objectives, and a shared projection (matrix A) that consolidates cross-modal commonalities. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AsymLoRA consistently surpasses both vanilla LoRA, which captures only commonalities, and LoRA-MoE, which focuses solely on conflicts, achieving superior model performance and system efficiency across diverse benchmarks.\href{Code}{https://github.com/Clin0212/HydraLoRA/blob/main/MLLM-HydraLoRA/README.md}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Adversarial Transferability in MLLMs via Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19672v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have recently gained attention for their capabilities in image recognition and understanding. However, while MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the transferability of these attacks across different models remains limited, especially under targeted attack setting. Existing methods primarily focus on vision-specific perturbations but struggle with the complex nature of vision-language modality alignment. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment (DynVLA) Attack, a novel approach that injects dynamic perturbations into the vision-language connector to enhance generalization across diverse vision-language alignment of different models. Our experimental results show that DynVLA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across various MLLMs, including BLIP2, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT4, LLaVA, and closed-source models such as Gemini.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09766</p></details> |
| **[M2-omni: Advancing Omni-MLLM for Comprehensive Modality Support with Competitive Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18778v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces OmniAlign-V, a comprehensive dataset of 200K high-quality training samples featuring diverse images, complex questions, and varied response formats to improve MLLMs' alignment with human preferences. We also present MM-AlignBench, a human-annotated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' alignment with human values. Experimental results show that finetuning MLLMs with OmniAlign-V, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), significantly enhances human preference alignment while maintaining or enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks, preserving their fundamental capabilities.

| **[MLLMs Know Where to Look: Training-free Perception of Small Visual Details with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17422v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid progress in visual recognition tasks in recent years. Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

This capability facilitates more efficient and intelligent data transmission in semantic communications. In this paper, we design a tailored MLLM for semantic communication and propose an MLLM-based Multi-modal, Multi-task and Multi-user Semantic Communication (M4SC) system. First, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to achieve multi-modal alignment in MLLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of semantics representation in the semantic space across different modalities. Next, we introduce a multi-task fine-tuning approach based on task instruction following, which leverages a unified task instruction template to describe various semantic communication tasks, improving the MLLM's ability to follow instructions across multiple tasks. Additionally, by designing a semantic sharing mechanism, we transmit the public and private semantic information of multiple users separately, thus increasing the efficiency of semantic communication. Finally, we employ a joint KAN-LLM-channel coding strategy to comprehensively enhance the performance of the semantic communication system in complex communication environments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed M4SC in multi-modal, multi-task, and multi-user scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Intuitively, leveraging past events as memory can enrich contextual and temporal understanding of the current event. In this paper, we show that leveraging memories as contexts helps MLLMs better understand video events. However, because such memories rely on predictions of preceding events, they may contain misinformation, leading to confabulation and degraded performance. To address this, we propose a confabulation-aware memory modification method that mitigates confabulated memory for memory-enhanced event understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper (5 pages)</p></details> |

Texts describing cultural procedures, including rituals, traditional craftsmanship, and social etiquette, require an inherent understanding of cultural context, presenting a significant challenge for mLLMs. In this work, we introduce CAPTex, a benchmark designed to evaluate mLLMs' ability to process and reason about culturally diverse procedural texts across multiple languages using various methodologies to assess their performance. Our findings indicate that (1) mLLMs face difficulties with culturally contextualized procedural texts, showing notable performance declines in low-resource languages, (2) model performance fluctuates across cultural domains, with some areas presenting greater difficulties, and (3) language models exhibit better performance on multiple-choice tasks within conversational frameworks compared to direct questioning. These results underscore the current limitations of mLLMs in handling culturally nuanced procedural texts and highlight the need for culturally aware benchmarks like CAPTex to enhance their adaptability and comprehension across diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Both Correctness and Coverage of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14914v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rendered traditional visual captioning benchmarks obsolete, as they primarily evaluate short descriptions with outdated metrics. While recent benchmarks address these limitations by decomposing captions into visual elements and adopting model-based evaluation, they remain incomplete-overlooking critical aspects, while providing vague, non-explanatory scores. To bridge this gap, we propose CV-CapBench, a Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark that systematically evaluates caption quality across 6 views and 13 dimensions. CV-CapBench introduces precision, recall, and hit rate metrics for each dimension, uniquely assessing both correctness and coverage. Experiments on leading MLLMs reveal significant capability gaps, particularly in dynamic and knowledge-intensive dimensions. These findings provide actionable insights for future research. The code and data will be released.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This study unmasks the culprit: "temporal hacking", a phenomenon where models shortcut by fixating on select frames, missing the full video narrative. In this work, we systematically establish a comprehensive theory of temporal hacking, defining it from a reinforcement learning perspective, introducing the Temporal Perplexity (TPL) score to assess this misalignment, and proposing the Unhackable Temporal Rewarding (UTR) framework to mitigate the temporal hacking. Both theoretically and empirically, TPL proves to be a reliable indicator of temporal modeling quality, correlating strongly with frame activation patterns. Extensive experiments reveal that UTR not only counters temporal hacking but significantly elevates video comprehension capabilities. This work not only advances video-AI systems but also illuminates the critical importance of aligning proxy rewards with true objectives in MLLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

| **[Mitigating Visual Knowledge Forgetting in MLLM Instruction-tuning via Modality-decoupled Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11740v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent MLLMs have shown emerging visual understanding and reasoning abilities after being pre-trained on large-scale multimodal datasets. Unlike pre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment, instruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading to the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual forgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual learning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing visual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention, which further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the degradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation through the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that leads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on this view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that regulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual representations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the information bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual understanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual knowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight instruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach using gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational overhead while preserving rich visual representations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks and backbone MLLMs demonstrate that MDGD effectively mitigates visual forgetting from pre-trained tasks while enabling strong adaptation to new tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To address this challenge, we propose Vision Dynamic Embedding-Guided Pretraining (VDEP), a hybrid autoregressive training paradigm for MLLMs. Utilizing dynamic embeddings from the MLP following the visual encoder, this approach supervises image hidden states and integrates image tokens into autoregressive training. Existing MLLMs primarily focused on recovering information from textual inputs, often neglecting the effective processing of image data. In contrast, the key improvement of this work is the reinterpretation of multimodal alignment as a process of recovering information from input data, with particular emphasis on reconstructing detailed visual features.The proposed method seamlessly integrates into standard models without architectural changes. Experiments on 13 benchmarks show VDEP outperforms baselines, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research. Additionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks, ethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns. We examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across various jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local or remote disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated integrated reuse and recompute mechanisms within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54% reduction in response time compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, the first version</p></details> |

The key distinction lies in how visual tokens are processed. Decoder-only architectures apply self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens, while cross-attention architectures skip these computations. To investigate whether redundancy exists in this computationally expensive process, we propose a training-free framework for analyzing trained MLLMs. It consists of Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN and Hollow Attention, which enable adjustable reductions in computations for visual tokens, as well as a Layer Ranking Algorithm that prioritizes layers for these reductions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial, structured, and clustered redundancy unique to decoder-only MLLMs, offering valuable insights for future MLLM architecture design. Furthermore, by leveraging our reduction framework as a training-free inference acceleration approach, we achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods while remaining compatible with them. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/L-Hugh/RedundancyLens.</p></details> |  |

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

The rapid growth has inevitably led to significant redundancy among benchmarks. Therefore, it is crucial to take a step back and critically assess the current state of redundancy and propose targeted principles for constructing effective MLLM benchmarks. In this paper, we focus on redundancy from three key perspectives: 1) Redundancy of benchmark capability dimensions, 2) Redundancy in the number of test questions, and 3) Cross-benchmark redundancy within specific domains. Through the comprehensive analysis over hundreds of MLLMs' performance across more than 20 benchmarks, we aim to quantitatively measure the level of redundancy lies in existing MLLM evaluations, provide valuable insights to guide the future development of MLLM benchmarks, and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy issues effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual RAG: Expanding MLLM visual knowledge without fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10834v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable performance in computer vision tasks that require reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet their capabilities are limited to their pre-trained data, requiring extensive fine-tuning for updates. Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, 375 references</p></details> |

Existing approaches often lack the adaptability needed to integrate ethical principles into dynamic and ambiguous contexts, limiting their effectiveness across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline the necessary ingredients for building a holistic, meta-level framework that combines intermediate representations, probabilistic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The specifications therein emphasize scalability, supporting ethical reasoning at both individual decision-making levels and within the collective dynamics of multi-agent systems. By integrating theoretical principles with contextual factors, it facilitates structured and context-aware decision-making, ensuring alignment with overarching ethical standards. We further explore proposed theorems outlining how ethical reasoners should operate, offering a foundation for practical implementation. These constructs aim to support the development of robust and ethically reliable AI systems capable of navigating the complexities of real-world moral decision-making scenarios.</p></details> |  |

One promising approach, particularly with decomposable problems, involves arranging intermediate solutions as a graph on which transformations are performed to explore the solution space. However, prior works rely on pre-determined, task-specific transformation schedules which are subject to a set of searched hyperparameters. In this work, we view thought graph transformations as actions in a Markov decision process, and implement policy agents to drive effective action policies for the underlying reasoning LLM agent. In particular, we investigate the ability for another LLM to act as a policy agent on thought graph environments and introduce ARIES, a multi-agent architecture for reasoning with LLMs. In ARIES, reasoning LLM agents solve decomposed subproblems, while policy LLM agents maintain visibility of the thought graph states, and dynamically adapt the problem-solving strategy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that using off-the-shelf LLMs as policy agents with no supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can yield up to $29\%$ higher accuracy on HumanEval relative to static transformation schedules, as well as reducing inference costs by $35\%$ and avoid any search requirements. We also conduct a thorough analysis of observed failure modes, highlighting that limitations on LLM sizes and the depth of problem decomposition can be seen as challenges to scaling LLM-guided reasoning.</p></details> |  |

The combination of separation logic and cryptographic reasoning allows us to prove the correctness of a protocol and later reuse this result to verify larger systems that rely on the protocol. To make this integration possible, we propose novel specifications for authentication protocols that allow agents in a network to agree on the use of system resources. We evaluate our approach by verifying various authentication protocols and a key-value store server that uses these authentication protocols to connect to clients. Our results are formalized in Coq.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Denoising Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21075v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/srm/</p></details> |

Although this approach improves interpretability and facilitates external auditing, it may not represent the most computationally efficient method for internal reasoning. In contrast, human cognition relies on implicit mental representations that recall past sensory and episodic information without requiring complete verbalization. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates implicit mental representations into the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Preliminary experiments indicate that incorporating an Implicit Memory Module (IMM) into a simple GPT model yields a reduction of between 35% and 57% in final training loss compared to a regular GPT baseline. The addition of an explicit interpretability channel (e.g., a chain-of-thought decoder) is straightforward to implement within this approach. We outline theoretical foundations, propose technical mechanisms to scale the memory module, and discuss how these ideas may lead to more efficient and robust reasoning, with optional future extensions for explicit auditability.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods primarily combine caption models and large language models (LLMs) to generate target captions based on composed queries but face various issues such as incompatibility, visual information loss, and insufficient reasoning. In this work, we propose CoTMR, a training-free framework crafted for ZS-CIR with novel Chain-of-thought (CoT) and Multi-scale Reasoning. Instead of relying on caption models for modality transformation, CoTMR employs the Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to achieve unified understanding and reasoning for composed queries. To enhance the reasoning reliability, we devise CIRCoT, which guides the LVLM through a step-by-step inference process using predefined subtasks. Considering that existing approaches focus solely on global-level reasoning, our CoTMR incorporates multi-scale reasoning to achieve more comprehensive inference via fine-grained predictions about the presence or absence of key elements at the object scale. Further, we design a Multi-Grained Scoring (MGS) mechanism, which integrates CLIP similarity scores of the above reasoning outputs with candidate images to realize precise retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoTMR not only drastically outperforms previous methods across four prominent benchmarks but also offers appealing interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</p></details> | 47 pages |

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise for multi-step reasoning, its effectiveness for long-context scenarios remains underexplored. Through systematic investigation across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that CoT's benefits generalize across most long-context scenarios and amplify with increasing context length. Motivated by this critical observation, we propose LongRePS, a process-supervised framework that teaches models to generate high-quality reasoning paths for enhanced long-context performance. Our framework incorporates a self-sampling mechanism to bootstrap reasoning paths and a novel quality assessment protocol specifically designed for long-context scenarios. Experimental results on various long-context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving significant improvements over outcome supervision baselines on both in-domain tasks (+13.6/+3.8 points for LLaMA/Qwen on MuSiQue) and cross-domain generalization (+9.3/+8.1 points on average across diverse QA tasks). Our code, data and trained models are made public to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 14 pages,6 figures |

This study explores how inter-model consensus enhances response reliability and serves as a proxy for assessing the quality of generated questions. To quantify agreement and consistency, we employ statistical methods including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa, and confidence interval analysis, measuring both response precision and question clarity. Our findings highlight that Claude and Gemini generate well-structured and less ambiguous questions, leading to higher inter-model agreement. This is reflected in their narrower confidence intervals and stronger alignment with answering models. Conversely, LLaMA demonstrates increased variability and lower reliability in question formulation, as indicated by broader confidence intervals and reduced consensus rates. These results suggest that multi-model collaboration not only enhances the reliability of responses but also provides a valuable framework for assessing and improving question quality in the absence of explicit ground truth. This research offers meaningful insights into optimizing AI-driven reasoning through collaborative large-language model interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.16797</p></details> |
| **[Teach-to-Reason with Scoring: Self-Explainable Rationale-Driven Multi-Trait Essay Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20748v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-trait automated essay scoring (AES) systems provide a fine-grained evaluation of an essay's diverse aspects. While they excel in scoring, prior systems fail to explain why specific trait scores are assigned. This lack of transparency leaves instructors and learners unconvinced of the AES outputs, hindering their practical use. To address this, we propose a self-explainable Rationale-Driven Multi-trait automated Essay scoring (RaDME) framework. RaDME leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by distilling them into a smaller yet effective scorer. This more manageable student model is optimized to sequentially generate a trait score followed by the corresponding rationale, thereby inherently learning to select a more justifiable score by considering the subsequent rationale during training. Our findings indicate that while LLMs underperform in direct AES tasks, they excel in rationale generation when provided with precise numerical scores. Thus, RaDME integrates the superior reasoning capacities of LLMs into the robust scoring accuracy of an optimized smaller model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RaDME achieves both accurate and adequate reasoning while supporting high-quality multi-trait scoring, significantly enhancing the transparency of AES.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that such errors frequently stem from spurious beliefs, propositions the model internally considers true but are incorrect. To address this, we propose a method to rectify the belief space by suppressing these spurious beliefs while simultaneously enhancing true ones, thereby enabling more reliable inferences. Our approach first identifies the beliefs that lead to incorrect or correct answers by prompting the model to generate textual explanations, using our Forward-Backward Beam Search (FBBS). We then apply unlearning to suppress the identified spurious beliefs and enhance the true ones, effectively rectifying the model's belief space. Empirical results on multiple QA datasets and LLMs show that our method corrects previously misanswered questions without harming overall model performance. Furthermore, our approach yields improved generalization on unseen data, suggesting that rectifying a model's belief space is a promising direction for mitigating errors and enhancing overall reliability.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the capability of leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, to provide logical and visual reasoning by directly using birds-eye-view videos of four-legged intersections. In this proposed method, GPT-4o acts as intelligent system to detect conflicts and provide explanations and recommendations for the drivers. The fine-tuned model achieved an accuracy of 77.14%, while the manual evaluation of the true predicted values of the fine-tuned GPT-4o showed significant achievements of 89.9% accuracy for model-generated explanations and 92.3% for the recommended next actions. These results highlight the feasibility of using MLLMs for real-time traffic management using videos as inputs, offering scalable and actionable insights into intersections traffic management and operation.

In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet computationally intractable problem: determining whether a given multivariate polynomial is nonnegative. This problem, closely related to Hilbert's Seventeenth Problem, plays a crucial role in global polynomial optimization and has applications in various fields. First, we introduce SoS-1K, a meticulously curated dataset of approximately 1,000 polynomials, along with expert-designed reasoning instructions based on five progressively challenging criteria. Evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that without structured guidance, all models perform only slightly above the random guess baseline 50%. However, high-quality reasoning instructions significantly improve accuracy, boosting performance up to 81%. Furthermore, our 7B model, SoS-7B, fine-tuned on SoS-1K for just 4 hours, outperforms the 671B DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini in accuracy while only requiring 1.8% and 5% of the computation time needed for letters, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to push the boundaries of mathematical reasoning and tackle NP-hard problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Strategic Reasoning Evaluation through Behavioral Game Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20432v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhantomWiki: On-Demand Datasets for Reasoning and Retrieval Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20377v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/kilian-group/phantom-wiki.</p></details> |  |

A common strategy involves generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories and aggregating their outputs through various selection mechanisms. This raises a fundamental question: can models with lower complexity leverage their superior generation throughput to outperform similarly sized Transformers for a fixed computational budget? To address this question and overcome the lack of strong subquadratic reasoners, we distill pure and hybrid Mamba models from pretrained Transformers. Trained on only 8 billion tokens, our distilled models show strong performance and scaling on mathematical reasoning datasets while being much faster at inference for large batches and long sequences. Despite the zero-shot performance hit due to distillation, both pure and hybrid Mamba models can scale their coverage and accuracy performance past their Transformer teacher models under fixed time budgets, opening a new direction for scaling inference compute.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20332v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have found evidence for emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models, but debate persists concerning the robustness of these capabilities, and the extent to which they depend on structured reasoning mechanisms. To shed light on these issues, we perform a comprehensive study of the internal mechanisms that support abstract rule induction in an open-source language model (Llama3-70B). We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.</p></details> |  |

However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

| **[Reward Learning from Multiple Feedback Types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21038v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning rewards from preference feedback has become an important tool in the alignment of agentic models. Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a binary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to acquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts is often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals of a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be mutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases for the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning from different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively. In this paper, we bridge this gap by enabling experimentation and evaluating multi-type feedback in a broad set of environments. We present a process to generate high-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement reward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types. Based on the simulated feedback, we investigate the use of types of feedback across ten RL environments and compare them to pure preference-based baselines. We show empirically that diverse types of feedback can be utilized and lead to strong reward modeling performance. This work is the first strong indicator of the potential of multi-type feedback for RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines. We provide analysis of the design choices of the reward models and policy, and show the efficacy of $\mu$Code at utilizing the execution feedback.

One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating Distribution Shift in Synthetic Data for Machine Translation Quality Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19941v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality Estimation (QE) models evaluate the quality of machine translations without reference translations, serving as the reward models for the translation task. Due to the data scarcity, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution. However, synthetic QE data often suffers from distribution shift, which can manifest as discrepancies between pseudo and real translations, or in pseudo labels that do not align with human preferences. To tackle this issue, we introduce ADSQE, a novel framework for alleviating distribution shift in synthetic QE data. To reduce the difference between pseudo and real translations, we employ the constrained beam search algorithm and enhance translation diversity through the use of distinct generation models. ADSQE uses references, i.e., translation supervision signals, to guide both the generation and annotation processes, enhancing the quality of word-level labels. ADSE further identifies the shortest phrase covering consecutive error tokens, mimicking human annotation behavior, to assign the final phrase-level labels. Specially, we underscore that the translation model can not annotate translations of itself accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like COMET in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Further analysis offers insights into synthetic data generation that could benefit reward models for other tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Learning Unlocks LLMs' Psycho-Counseling Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19731v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying large language models (LLMs) to assist in psycho-counseling is an emerging and meaningful approach, driven by the significant gap between patient needs and the availability of mental health support. However, current LLMs struggle to consistently provide effective responses to client speeches, largely due to the lack of supervision from high-quality real psycho-counseling data, whose content is typically inaccessible due to client privacy concerns. Furthermore, the quality of therapists' responses in available sessions can vary significantly based on their professional training and experience. Assessing the quality of therapists' responses remains an open challenge. In this work, we address these challenges by first proposing a set of professional and comprehensive principles to evaluate therapists' responses to client speeches. Using these principles, we create a preference dataset, PsychoCounsel-Preference, which contains 36k high-quality preference comparison pairs. This dataset aligns with the preferences of professional psychotherapists, providing a robust foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in psycho-counseling. Experiments on reward modeling and preference learning demonstrate that PsychoCounsel-Preference is an excellent resource for LLMs to acquire essential skills for responding to clients in a counseling session. Our best-aligned model, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B, achieves an impressive win rate of 87% against GPT-4o. We release PsychoCounsel-Preference, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B and the reward model PsychoCounsel Llama3-8B-Reward to facilitate the research of psycho-counseling with LLMs at: https://hf.co/Psychotherapy-LLM.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Self-rewarding correction for mathematical reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19613v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study self-rewarding reasoning large language models (LLMs), which can simultaneously generate step-by-step reasoning and evaluate the correctness of their outputs during the inference time-without external feedback. This integrated approach allows a single model to independently guide its reasoning process, offering computational advantages for model deployment. We particularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models autonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when to terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a two-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning models using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential rejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that incorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning models on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of self-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the models' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. Experiments with Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 demonstrate that our approach surpasses intrinsic self-correction capabilities and achieves performance comparable to systems that rely on external reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distill Not Only Data but Also Rewards: Can Smaller Language Models Surpass Larger Ones?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19557v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilling large language models (LLMs) typically involves transferring the teacher model's responses through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, this approach neglects the potential to distill both data (output content) and reward signals (quality evaluations). Extracting reliable reward signals directly from teacher models is challenging, as LLMs are optimized for generation rather than evaluation, often resulting in biased or inconsistent assessments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel distillation pipeline that transfers both responses and rewards. Our method generates pseudo-rewards through a self-supervised mechanism that leverages the inherent structure of both teacher and student responses, enabling reward learning without explicit external evaluation. The reward model subsequently guides reinforcement learning (RL), allowing iterative refinement of the student model after an SFT warm-up phase. Experiments on GSM8K and MMLU-PRO demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional SFT-based approaches, enabling student models to surpass the performance of their teachers. This work highlights the potential for scalable, efficient distillation through structured self-supervised reward learning, reducing dependence on external reward supervision.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first four authors contributed equally, 27 pages</p></details> |

However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models. Our codes are publicly released to facilitate further research (https://github.com/THU-KEG/Agentic-Reward-Modeling).</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Inspired by the strong in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, we propose Few-Shot Preference Optimization (FSPO), which reframes reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Under this framework, an LLM learns to quickly adapt to a user via a few labeled preferences from that user, constructing a personalized reward function for them. Additionally, since real-world preference data is scarce and challenging to collect at scale, we propose careful design choices to construct synthetic preference datasets for personalization, generating over 1M synthetic personalized preferences using publicly available LLMs. In particular, to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real users, we find it crucial for the data to exhibit both high diversity and coherent, self-consistent structure. We evaluate FSPO on personalized open-ended generation for up to 1,500 synthetic users across across three domains: movie reviews, pedagogical adaptation based on educational background, and general question answering, along with a controlled human study. Overall, FSPO achieves an 87% Alpaca Eval winrate on average in generating responses that are personalized to synthetic users and a 72% winrate with real human users in open-ended question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://fewshot-preference-optimization.github.io/</p></details> |

A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's ability to cover the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose a theoretical transfer learning algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop an empirical algorithm with improved computational efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically in summarization tasks.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[OneRec: Unifying Retrieve and Rank with Generative Recommender and Iterative Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18965v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generative retrieval-based recommendation systems have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, most modern recommender systems adopt a retrieve-and-rank strategy, where the generative model functions only as a selector during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we propose OneRec, which replaces the cascaded learning framework with a unified generative model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end generative model that significantly surpasses current complex and well-designed recommender systems in real-world scenarios. Specifically, OneRec includes: 1) an encoder-decoder structure, which encodes the user's historical behavior sequences and gradually decodes the videos that the user may be interested in. We adopt sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to scale model capacity without proportionally increasing computational FLOPs. 2) a session-wise generation approach. In contrast to traditional next-item prediction, we propose a session-wise generation, which is more elegant and contextually coherent than point-by-point generation that relies on hand-crafted rules to properly combine the generated results. 3) an Iterative Preference Alignment module combined with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the quality of the generated results. Unlike DPO in NLP, a recommendation system typically has only one opportunity to display results for each user's browsing request, making it impossible to obtain positive and negative samples simultaneously. To address this limitation, We design a reward model to simulate user generation and customize the sampling strategy. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that a limited number of DPO samples can align user interest preferences and significantly improve the quality of generated results. We deployed OneRec in the main scene of Kuaishou, achieving a 1.6\% increase in watch-time, which is a substantial improvement.</p></details> |  |

Yet, we lack a reliable, easy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical abilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an open-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench contains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor abilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To score the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a reward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses with high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on MathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability, does not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject expertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of tutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become more challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin to fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid benchmarking of future models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://eth-lre.github.io/mathtutorbench</p></details> |
| **[Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training.

Yet its reliance on a singular reward model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning. However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences, outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discriminative Finetuning of Generative Large Language Models without Reward Models and Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18679v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference optimization (PO) denoted by SFT$\rightarrow$PO has become the standard for improving pretrained large language models (LLMs), with PO demonstrating significant performance gains. However, PO methods rely on either human-labeled preference data or a strong reward model to generate preference data. Can we fine-tune LLMs without preference data or reward models while achieving competitive performance to SFT$\rightarrow$PO? We address this question by introducing Discriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), a novel approach that eliminates the need for preference data. Unlike SFT, which employs a generative approach and overlooks negative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that that increases the probability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones, shifting from token prediction to data prediction. Our contributions include: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by explicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all possible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this discriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's effectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not better than SFT$\rightarrow$PO.

Reward-free alternatives, like self-consistency and universal self-consistency, are limited in their ability to handle open-ended generation tasks or scale effectively. To address these limitations, we propose self-certainty, a novel and efficient metric that leverages the inherent probability distribution of LLM outputs to estimate response quality without requiring external reward models. We hypothesize that higher distributional self-certainty, aggregated across multiple samples, correlates with improved response accuracy, as it reflects greater confidence in the generated output. Through extensive experiments on various reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that self-certainty (1) scales effectively with increasing sample size $N$, akin to reward models but without the computational overhead; (2) complements chain-of-thought, improving reasoning performance beyond greedy decoding; and (3) generalizes to open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency methods fall short. Our findings establish self-certainty as a practical and efficient way for improving LLM reasoning capabilities.

| **[AgentRM: Enhancing Agent Generalization with Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18407v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM-based agents have achieved strong performance on held-in tasks, but their generalizability to unseen tasks remains poor. Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability. In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model. Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search. We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge. We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and step-level beam search. On four types of nine agent tasks, AgentRM enhances the base policy model by $8.8$ points on average, surpassing the top general agent by $4.0$. Moreover, it demonstrates weak-to-strong generalization, yielding greater improvement of $12.6$ on LLaMA-3-70B policy model. As for the specializability, AgentRM can also boost a finetuned policy model and outperform the top specialized agent by $11.4$ on three held-in tasks. Further analysis verifies its effectiveness in test-time scaling. Codes will be released to facilitate the research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linguistic Generalizability of Test-Time Scaling in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17407v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling pre-training compute has proven effective for achieving mulitlinguality, but does the same hold for test-time scaling? In this work, we introduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome Reward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing (BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for extended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM achieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2. Although "thinking LLMs" have recently garnered significant attention, we find that their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. Moreover, while BF yields a 20-point improvement on English AIME, it provides only a 1.94-point average gain across other languages-a pattern consistent across the other test-time scaling methods we studied-higlighting that test-time scaling may not generalize as effectively to multilingual tasks. To foster further research, we release MCLM, MR1-1.5B, and evaluation results.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Cheems: A Practical Guidance for Building and Evaluating Chinese Reward Models from Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17173v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</p></details> |  |
